## üóÉÔ∏è Database Design

### Key Entities & Fields

- **Users**
  - `id`, `name`, `email`, `password_hash`, `role`
  - A user can own multiple properties and make multiple bookings.

- **Properties**
  - `id`, `title`, `description`, `location`, `price_per_night`, `owner_id`
  - Each property is listed by a user and can receive multiple bookings and reviews.

- **Bookings**
  - `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `start_date`, `end_date`, `status`
  - A booking links a user to a property for a specific date range.

- **Reviews**
  - `id`, `user_id`, `property_id`, `rating`, `comment`, `created_at`
  - Users can leave reviews for properties they‚Äôve booked.

- **Payments**
  - `id`, `booking_id`, `amount`, `payment_method`, `status`, `timestamp`
  - Each payment is tied to a booking and tracks transaction details.

## ‚ú® Feature Breakdown

- **User Management**
  - Registration, login, profile updates, and role-based access control.
  - Ensures secure and personalized user experiences.

- **Property Management**
  - Users can list, edit, and delete properties with rich descriptions and media.
  - Enables hosts to manage their offerings efficiently.

- **Booking System**
  - Real-time availability checks, booking creation, and status tracking.
  - Facilitates smooth reservation flows for guests.

- **Review System**
  - Users can rate and review properties post-stay.
  - Builds trust and transparency within the platform.

- **Payment Integration**
  - Secure payment processing and transaction history.
  - Supports multiple payment methods and ensures financial accountability.

## üîê API Security

### Key Measures

- **Authentication**
  - Uses token-based authentication (e.g., JWT) to verify user identity.

- **Authorization**
  - Role-based access ensures users can only perform permitted actions.

- **Rate Limiting**
  - Prevents abuse by limiting the number of requests per user/IP.

### Why It Matters

- Protects sensitive user data and personal information.
- Secures financial transactions and booking details.
- Prevents unauthorized access and potential breaches.

## üöÄ CI/CD Pipeline

### What is CI/CD?

CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) automates the process of testing, building, and deploying code. It ensures faster development cycles, fewer bugs, and consistent releases.

### Tools Used

- **GitHub Actions**: Automates testing and deployment workflows.
- **Docker**: Ensures consistent environments across development and production.
- **Heroku / AWS / Render**: Potential platforms for hosting and deployment.
